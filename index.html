Of all the men in the whole wide world,<br>
Whose praises are sung out loud,<br>
There is no man whom I respect more,<br>
Or of whom I am more proud.<br>

Throughout the years, youâ€™ve worked so hard<br>
To provide us a happy life;<br>
Youâ€™ve been there to help and give advice,<br>
And you did it all without strife.<br>

That is why on this day each year,<br>
I pray all your wishes come true;<br>
Today we celebrate your life,<br>
So Dad, Happy Birthday to you.<br>
